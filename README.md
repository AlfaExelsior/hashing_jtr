Setup Instructions
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install any dependencies with:

pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
Ensure John the Ripper is installed on your machine. If you're running on Kali Linux, it should already be available.

2. Usage
Hashing
To hash a string, run:

python src/hashing.py
John the Ripper
To run John the Ripper on a password file:

python src/john_runner.py
Kali Linux Commands
To execute a Kali Linux command:

python src/kali_commands.py
Ethical Considerations
Ensure to use John the Ripper only on systems and files you have permission to test.

Testing
Run the unit tests with:

python -m unittest discover -s tests
This will run all the tests for the project, including hashing, John the Ripper, and Kali Linux commands.
